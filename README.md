# Lucifer

This is an implementation of Arthur Sorkin’s variant of the
[Lucifer block cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_(cipher)), a direct
predecessor of DES, ported from FORTRAN IV to FORTRAN 77. The cipher has a 128
bit block size and a 128 bit key length.

The code of the original version was listed in the following paper:
